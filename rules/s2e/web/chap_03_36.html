                        <p>Now that the session or Episode is complete, it is time to look back on it, and to look ahead to the next one. A very important aspect of story development as it pertains to pen and paper roleplaying is considering what has happened, and what will happen next. This section provides and explains four key questions to ask yourself between sessions or Episodes.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="textbox">
                        <h2 id="fair">Was it Fair?</h2>

                        <p>Consider the challenges faced by the characters. Were they too difficult, too easy, or just challenging enough to be worthwhile? Did you favor one character over another unfairly? It is a natural tendency of many GM’s to lean one way or another, but it is also vital to keeping the trust of the players that the GM remain as neutral as possible when it comes to game balance.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="textbox">
                        <h2 id="onrails">Was it on Rails?</h2>

                        <p>Consider the direction the plot took. Was it the result of the characters’ actions, or was it forced on them? Were the players free to make their characters do what they wished, as much as possible? GM’s who have a good story often tend to ‘guide’ their players down the course of action they themselves know to be the right one (or the wrong one). But this is an example of railroading, which ultimately erodes the players’ trust in their GM.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="textbox">
                        <h2 id="whatnow">What Happens Now?</h2>

                        <p>Consider what happened over the course of the story. What are the consequences of these events? Will they affect the characters somewhere down the line, and if so, how? No group of characters exists entirely in a vacuum; it is important to think about how events get set into motion, and to reflect the consequences of the characters’ actions (positive or negative) within the future events of the story.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="textbox">
                        <h2 id="donext">What do I do next?</h2>

                        <p>Consider what needs to be done in preparation for the next session or Episode. Do you need to rewrite parts of the plot to accommodate what the players and their characters have done? Do you need to alter upcoming events to ensure the players have as much fun as possible? While some GM’s can do their preparation before the next session, for most, it is a good idea to do it as soon after a session as possible, while the story is still fresh in their mind.</p>
