                        <p>As characters adventure in Equestria, they learn from their experiences and grow over time. This growth is not just in power and ability, but also in their wisdom and how they look at the world around them. In My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, this is represented at the end of each episode by the ‘letter to the Princess’ which concludes many episodes—imparting lessons learned, and what characters’ experiences have taught them. Sometimes, it is a simple confirmation that they were right all along, showing that same growth in action.</p>

                        <p>In My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic, it is the same way. At the conclusion of each Episode of the game, the players develop a sort of ‘letter to the Princess’ about what their characters learned from the Episode, what challenges they overcame, and potentially, what they already knew that they were able to meaningfully apply to situations. To reflect the growth in power and ability which typically goes along with such personal growth, characters gain experience points based on this letter to the Princess, and spend those experience points in a variety of ways to improve themselves.</p>

                    <div class="textbox">

                        <p>Experience points are the measure of how much a character has grown over time based on their experiences; because they are spent by players to improve their character in a variety of different ways, how this growth manifests itself is different from character to character. However, the core fact remains that it is the result of experiences and lessons learned. For Twilight Sparkle and her friends, they are fortunate enough to have the responsibility and the honor of reporting on these lessons and experiences in a formal manner, by writing letters summarizing them. However, in many traditional pen and paper roleplaying games, this is not true. Characters are assumed to be growing and advancing, though they may not always show change, or be aware of the nature and reason of their growth.</p>

                        <p>In My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic, character growth is dependent upon the acknowledgement and understanding of the relevant and important lessons and experiences which cause that character’s growth. This moves the advancement of a character’s ability out of the realm of “what can I accomplish?” and into the realm of “what can I learn?” This is handled in a group discussion style phase at the end of an Episode, in which the characters ‘write a letter to the Princess’ about what they learned. The letter itself isn’t literal, and the group discussion doesn’t need to be modeled on a letter. What is most important is the identification of lessons learned and applied, challenges overcome, and character growth occurring.</p>

                    <div class="textbox">
                        <h3 id="til">Today I Learned</h3>

                        <p>Unlike many pen and paper roleplaying games, the players have the most responsibility during the letter to the Princess phase; it is up to them to pay attention during an Episode, identify lessons their characters learned and how their characters grew, and then articulate those points to the GM. The GM then considers what the players presented, makes some decisions on what they agree or disagree with, and awards experience points based on the results.</p>

                        <p>For example, during an Episode, one player’s character ended up saving pony toddlers several times from a bad storm, and taking care of them; by the end of the Episode, whenever danger first showed up, they began to think about the safety of the infants before their own. During the letter to the Princess phase, that character’s player uses that experience as a way to express character growth: their character’s experience with the infants taught the character that children aren’t as annoying as they once thought, and that they might in fact want to work with children as their job.</p>

                        <p>The general rule is that for each valid point of character growth presented by each member of the group to the GM, which the GM agrees with, each member of the group gains an experience point. Typically, this should even out to an average of one experience point per major plot point, or game session involving an important challenge the characters overcame. However, it is not uncommon for certain Episodes to give especially high or low experience point rewards, based on how the group did—there is no guarantee that a character will grow as a result of experiences, after all.</p>

                        <p>For example, in a group of three players, one player’s character earns one experience point for the group; the second character earns two, and the third earns one. Pooled together, this totals four points; meaning that each character gains four experience points as a reward for completing the Episode, reflecting the character growth they have shown.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that characters in My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic are not meant to be overly competitive with each other, and the arena of character growth is no exception. During the letter to the Princess phase, players are encouraged to work together, discussing the Episode, what their characters did, how they grew, and help each other with their characters’ growth. What one player might have missed, another might have seen—and it is better for the group not to miss any opportunities. In fact, groups who handle the letter to the Princess phase especially well may find their GM being more generous with experience points than they would be if each player was trying to look out for themselves first.</p>

                        <p>While the standard experience point gain system is designed to work well for games and stories which follow the general style and feel of the cartoon, some fanfiction-based and custom-designed Episodes may not involve character growth as such an important factor. In that case, it is generally best for the GM to simply award one experience point per plot challenge the group accomplished—or, to make things even simpler, one experience point per game session in which the group made real progress toward accomplishing the objective of the Episode.</p>

                        <p>Experience points can be used in three ways by all characters: to purchase character advancements (what most players think of as spending experience points), to purchase temporary bonuses (for a scene-length boost of ability), or to restore lost Willpower early (putting their experience toward faith in themselves). These three ways are in addition to any other ways a character may be entitled to use experience points, granted by special abilities, racial abilities, or the like. In this section, each of these three general ways of using experience points are explained in detail; including a bank of character advancements which characters may purchase.</p>

                        <p>Character advancements are what most players usually think of when they think of spending experience to improve their character. In traditional pen and paper roleplaying games, these might be called ‘traits,’ ‘feats,’ ‘edges,’ ‘abilities,’ or the like, and run the spectrum from Skill Level increases, to Attribute Points, to special powers, to augmentations to current abilities, to new Skills and Jobs, to pets and companions/assistants. Character advancements, by default, are only purchased before, or after, the action of a game session—unless specifically allowed by the GM, they cannot be purchased ‘mid-game,’ or in the middle of a situation or scene.</p>

                        <p>What follows is a list of character advancements in My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic, separated into three categories: <em>Improvements</em>, which are generally increases in things a character already has (such as improving a Skill’s Level), <em>Developments</em>, which are generally additions of new things to a character which that character could have gained through character creation as normal (such as a new Job or Spell), and <em>Special Abilities</em>, which are generally additions of new things to a character which can only be gained through their purchase with experience points (such as a special power or an animal companion).</p>

                        <p>Each character advancement has its own experience point cost, requirements to be fulfilled before it can be purchased, effects, and restrictions.</p>

                        <p>Characters may purchase a temporary bonus at any time, which improves all their check results for the duration of a scene.
