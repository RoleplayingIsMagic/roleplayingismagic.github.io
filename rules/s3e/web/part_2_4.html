You may spend a point of Virtue and roll 1d6. For the duration of this scene, any ‘damage d6’ rolled by the GM to deal damage to you, which does not result in a number equal to or higher than your initial roll, does not deal damage to you. You may not spend more than one point of Virtue per Scene for this effect. <em>(For example, you spend a point of Virtue and activate this Edge, rolling 1d6. If you rolled a 4, any ‘damage d6’ rolled against you in this scene </em><em>resulting in</em><em>&nbsp;a 3 or below is discarded; in o</em><em>ther words,</em><em>&nbsp;you can only be harmed by 4’s, 5’s, and 6’s.)</em></p> <h3>Determined</h3><p>Activate on your turn. You may spend a point of Virtue to recover from being Sidelined, and immediately regain 5d6 Fortitude and Willpower. This Edge can only affect you; it may not be used to allow other characters to recover from being Sidelined. You may not spend more than one point of Virtue per Scene for this effect.</p> <h3>Enlightened</h3><p>Activate on your turn. You may spend a point of Virtue to reduce the level of any spells you cast for the duration of this Scene by half&nbsp;(rounded up), thus decreasing the amount of Fortitude and / or Willpower you must pay to cast them. You may not spend more than one point of Virtue per Scene for this effect. This effect takes place before any other reduction to the cost of casting your spells. <em>(For example, when casting a spell of level 31, you reduce its level by half, rounded up—in this case, to 16.)</em></p> <h3>Inspirational</h3><p>Activate on your turn. You may spend a point of Virtue to cause any and all friends who have been Sidelined to recover from being Sidelined, and all friends (Sidelined or not) immediately regain 3d6 Fortitude and Willpower each (roll once and apply the result to everyone). You may not use this Edge if you are Sidelined, and you may not spend more than one point of Virtue per Scene for this effect.</p> <h3>Lucky</h3><p>Activate on your turn. You may spend a point of Virtue to re-roll the lowest single d6 on any failed Skill Checks you make this Scene, and take the new result instead. You may not spend more than one point of Virtue per Scene for this effect.</p> <h2>Story Edges</h2> <h3>Big Crown Thingy</h3><p>You possess some mystical artifact, magic item, or other object with unique qualities. Work with your GM to determine the details, and the limitations, if any, of this artifact. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Diamond in the Rough</h3><p>You are notably attractive, especially pretty or handsome. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Fan Club</h3><p>You have a group of admirers, or perhaps one or two die-hard fans. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Fantastic Family</h3><p>You have an immediate family member who will generally help you when you call on them, if they are able to. Work with your GM to determine the details. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Far and Wide</h3><p>You are fairly well known as a celebrity for something or other. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Fortune's Favor</h3><p>You are more wealthy than normal characters, within reason. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Home Sweet Home</h3><p>You have a dwelling which you own, and which is suited to your purposes. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Jester, Sailor, Soldier, Spy</h3><p>You hold some office, rank, or station above normal characters. Work with your GM to determine the details. At the GM’s discretion, this Edge may impact the story in a positive or negative way. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Mare of Mystery</h3><p>You have a secondary persona, an alter-ego, which you can make use of freely. This affords you anonymity when you need it, but must be kept secret! Work with your GM to determine the exact nature of this alter-ego. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Masterful Mentor</h3><p>You have a teacher, mentor, or patron who has your best interests at heart. While they may not always be able to provide direct assistance, they can help you with guidance and advice at the GM’s discretion. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Number One Assistant</h3><p>You have an assistant in your service (the exact nature of which should be worked out with the GM); they can carry out reasonably complex commands and are able to assist you with reasonably complex tasks at the GM’s discretion. Your assistant has a mind of its own, however, and may disobey you or cause trouble on its own. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Perfect Pet</h3><p>You have some small, lesser animal as a loyal pet (the exact nature of which should be worked out with the GM); they can carry out simple commands and are able to assist you with basic tasks at the GM’s discretion. In general, your pet will obey whatever you tell it to do, and will avoid causing trouble on its own. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h3>Studious Student</h3><p>You have a student, apprentice, or some other kind of character who looks up to you as a mentor and may come to you for guidance or advice. Work with your GM to determine the details. How this Edge may impact the story is up to the GM’s discretion, as you do not control your student—they are a separate entity under GM control. This Edge requires GM approval.</p> <h2>Power Edges</h2> <h3>Bits and Bobs</h3><p>Once per Episode, you may declare that your character brought “just the thing” for the situation at hand. Work with your GM to determine what object or Tool your character then pulls from seemingly nowhere.</p> <h3>Dire Straits</h3><p>Once per Episode, when you are dealt damage which would Sideline you, you may use this Edge. If you do, you are prevented from being Sidelined by the damage; instead, you are reduced to one point of Fortitude and / or Willpower, whichever type would have otherwise been reduced to zero.</p> <h3>Musical Number</h3><p>Once per Episode, your character may break into an inspiring musical number; this allows your entire group to recover all of their lost Fortitude and Willpower as if they had been able to make a focused recovery. This ability may not be used in Cinematic mode, or when facing danger or a direct threat. <em>(Actual singing by players is optional, but encouraged!)</em></p> <h3>Share and Care</h3><p>Once per Episode, you may 'sacrifice' any amount of Fortitude and/or Willpower, and give that much of each to a non-Sidelined friend to heal them. Fortitude replaces Fortitude, and Willpower replaces Willpower; the types must match. You may even Sideline yourself if you sacrifice too much!</p> <h3>Signature Move</h3><p>Work with your GM to develop a special power that only your character has, as well as its effects. This Edge correlates to the in-show abilities of Fluttershy’s Stare, Pinkie Pie’s Pinkie Sense, and Rainbow Dash’s ability to produce Sonic Rainbooms, among others. Once per Episode, by spending a point of Virtue, you may use it.</p> <h3>Words of Wizardry</h3><p>Choose a single spell your character can already cast, and assign this Edge to it. Once per Episode, your character may recite a mystical rhyme as part of casting the chosen spell. These magic words contain the power necessary to sustain the spell, reducing its Level (and thus, its cost to cast) to zero. <em>(Actual recitation of a rhyme by players is optional, but encouraged!)</em></p> <h2>Advantage Edges</h2> <h3>Doubly Mirrored</h3><p>Immediately gain and spend two Advancements.</p> <h3>Good Natured</h3><p>When you spend a point of Virtue for any reason, roll 1d6. If the result is a 5 or a 6, you gain the benefit of the point as normal, but the Virtue&nbsp;is not actually spent.</p> <h3>Lead Pony</h3><p>If at least one friend is assisting you in a Skill Check, you gain an additional +1 bonus to the Skill Check. This is only applied once, even if multiple friends assist, and the maximum of 5 assistants still applies (though this way the total bonuses may exceed +5).</p> <h3>Noble Soul</h3><p>You begin each Episode with 1 extra point of Virtue.</p> <h3>Spirited</h3><p>When you spend a point of Virtue to restore Fortitude and Willpower, you gain the effects of having spent two points of Virtue instead. You may spend each in any way you choose, between yourself or friends.</p> <h3>True, True Friend</h3><p>Once per Scene, when a friend would take damage, you may elect to "take the hit" in their place. You are dealt half of the damage your friend would have taken, rounded down; your friend takes no damage.</p> <h3>Wing Pony</h3><p>Whenever you assist a friend with a Skill Check, you grant them an additional +1 bonus. The limit of 5 maximum assistants still applies&nbsp;(though this way the total bonuses may exceed +5).</p> <h2>Luck Edges</h2> <h3>Daring Doings</h3><p>Once per Episode, before rolling a Skill Check, you may force it to be treated as a Critical result regardless of the subsequent dice roll. This may turn the result into a Critical success or a Critical failure depending on what the outcome of the Skill Check is as normal.</p> <h3>Last Chance</h3><p>When things are at their absolute worst, sometimes you may get one last chance to save the day. Once per Episode, when everyone in your group has been Sidelined, you may choose to take a ‘last chance’ and make a 1d6 roll. If this roll is a 1, nothing happens. Otherwise, on a roll of 2 through 6, you immediately recover from being Sidelined and are restored to full Fortitude and Willpower. In either case, the ‘last chance’ is used up, and you may not use this effect again for the rest of the Episode.</p> <h3>Maverick</h3><p>You have a more direct tie to Lady Luck than most. This Edge modifies the “Critical Doubles” rule for your character, adding a chance for automatic successes and automatic failures. By default, even if your character rolls high doubles, they may fail a check, and the doubles would make that ‘high failure’ a critical failure. By the same token, if your character rolls low doubles, they may still succeed at a check, and doubles would make that ‘low success’ a critical success. This Edge allows a character to have a small chance at automatically succeeding on a double-six high roll, but also automatically failing on a double-one low roll. From now on, add the following to the Critical Doubles rule for your character:</p><p><strong><em>On a Double 6’s result:</em></strong>&nbsp;Your character automatically critically succeeds at the task they are attempting.</p><p><strong><em>On a Double 1’s result:</em></strong>&nbsp;Your character automatically critically fails at the task they are attempting.</p> <h3>Stacked Deck</h3><p>You are able to make the most of your good luck, by saving it for a more opportune time. Whenever you achieve a Critical success at a Skill Check, you may choose to ‘bank’ the ‘Critical’ part of the success, saving it for later. This converts your Critical success into a normal success instead, but allows you to ‘spend’ the saved Critical in one of two ways at any point during the rest of the Episode. You may spend the saved Critical to either improve a normal success (yours or someone else’s) to a Critical success, or to change a Critical failure (yours or someone else’s) into a normal failure instead. You may choose to make this change after the GM has determined the outcome of the Skill Check. You may only have one Critical saved like this at any time, and at the end of the Episode, you lose the saved Critical; it does not carry over into the next Episode.</p> <h2>Skill Edges</h2> <h3>General Training</h3><p>Choose one Skill category; increase any Skills below Rank 10 in that category by one Rank. <em>For instance, if you </em><em>chose the “Doctor” category, the Skills Diagnosis, Surgery, and Treatment would all increase by one Rank.</em></p> <h3>Pony Prodigy</h3><p>Choose either Mind, Body, or Heart. Any of your Skills based on the chosen Attribute which are Rank 1 or above grant an additional +1 bonus to Skill Checks with them.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Ballistics Training</h3><p>All Skills in the “Marksman” category use the base attribute Mind instead of Body.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Method Actor</h3><p>All Skills in the “Actor” category use the base attribute Mind instead of Heart.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Natural Equilibrium</h3><p>All Skills in the “Ascetic” category use the base attribute Body instead of Mind.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Need for Speed</h3><p>All Skills in the “Pilot” category use the base attribute Heart instead of Body.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Stage Presence</h3><p>All Skills in the “Performer” category use the base attribute Body instead of Heart.</p> <h3>Skill Swap: Wild Talent</h3><p>All Skills in the “Magician” category use the base attribute Heart instead of Mind.</p> <h2>Racial Edges</h2> <h3>Alchemical Genius</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Zebra characters.</em></p><p>You may make use of Recipes involving the normally-restricted Magical Aspects of Mass, Unknown, Persistent, and Wonder (Recipes are still subject to GM discretion and approval) from this point on (including any Recipes you learn at the same time you gain this Edge). When you make use of a Recipe involving one or more of these Magical Aspects, that use counts as one additional Alchemical Item use for the Episode for each of these Magical Aspects it involves. <em>(For example, if you used a Recipe which involved the ‘Mass’ and ‘Unknown’ Magical Aspects, you would expend three Alchemical Item uses instead of the normal one.)</em></p> <h3>Blaster Caster</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Unicorn characters.</em></p><p>At the beginning of an Episode, you gain a unique pool of “Energy”&nbsp;points equal to your Fortitude or Willpower score, whichever is higher. These Energy points may be spent in place of Fortitude and / or Willpower points for the purposes of paying the cost of casting spells only. They are not used for any other purpose. Energy points are only refilled at the beginning of an Episode or at the GM’s discretion.</p> <h3>Pride of the Skies</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Griffon characters.</em></p><p>When you activate the ‘Lionheart’ Special Ability, you now also gain a reduction to any Fortitude and Willpower damage amounts you take while it is active, equal to twice the Skill bonus the Lionheart Special Ability grants you. <em>(For example, if the Special Ability grants you a +3 Skill bonus, you gain damage reduction of -6 as well.) </em>This damage reduction cannot reduce the damage you take to 0, only to a minimum of 1 point per ‘hit.’</p> <h3>Quick Learner</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Earth Pony characters.</em></p><p>You gain half-again the number of Skill Points you would normally gain from Advancements you choose. For example, if you chose Training, you would gain 6 Skill Points instead of the normal 4. Likewise, if you chose Balance, you would gain 3 Skill Points instead of the normal 2. This effect does not apply to Skill Points gained in any other way besides Advancements, and is not retroactive.</p> <h3>Total Recall</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Crystal Pony characters.</em></p><p>The ‘Recovering Memory’ Natural Ability now also allows you to ‘save’ one Edge at a time, in the same way that you may save an Advancement. In addition, you may now save up to two Advancements at a time.</p> <h3>Weather Witch</h3><p><em>This Edge may only be chosen by Pegasus characters.</em></p><p>Instead of spending 1d6 points of Fortitude or Willpower per weather effect to utilize the ‘Weather Patrol’ Special Ability, you instead only pay 1 point per weather effect.</p> <h2>Special Edges</h2> <h3>Code of Honor</h3><p>Work with your GM to come up with a few behavioral rules your character follows as a 'Code Of Honor.' If they are put into a situation where upholding this Code Of Honor would make things significantly and meaningfully more difficult for them (at the GM's discretion), if they choose to uphold their Code Of Honor and take on the consequences, they may earn a point of Virtue.</p> <h3>Fatal Flaw</h3><p>Develop a flaw or fault with your GM that your character struggles with. Whenever your character meaningfully overcomes their flaw (at the GM's discretion), they may earn a point of Virtue.</p> <h3>Magic Trick</h3><p>Create a single spell, with a Spell Level no higher than (Mind + Heart + 4). You know and may cast this spell at will, paying its cost and making the appropriate Spellcasting Skill Check as normal, even if you cannot normally cast spells. This 'magic trick' must be approved by the GM.</p>
