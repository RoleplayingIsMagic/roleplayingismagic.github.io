                        <h2 name="p9-1"> Plot Points</h2>  
<p>This variant allows characters to have a number of Plot Points from the following list of 24 Plot Points; the GM decides how many Plot Points a character may have. At the GM's discretion, players may freely choose all of their character's Plot Points, may randomly determine them by rolling a number of d6's, or may randomly determine some of them and freely choose the rest. This variant is intended for characters who are meant to be established within the world, but have not been played before.</p>
 
<p>By and large, Plot Points are for narrative purposes only; Plot Points do not convey a mechanical bonus to a character, though they can add nuance and flavor, can influence how a character is roleplayed, and may have an impact on situations or the story as a whole. Characters may acquire certain Plot Points after character creation if the GM awards them. In addition, GMs are allowed to make up new Plot Points as they see fit, using this list for reference.</p>
 
<p>If the GM calls for Plot Points to be determined randomly, each player rolls 1d6 per Plot Point they are entitled to. These d6's are rolled in order, not all at once. After each d6 has been rolled, the player moves down the Plot Point list below by a number of steps equal to the amount shown on the d6. Whichever Plot Point they stop on, they gain. The next d6 proceeds further down the list from the last Plot Point gained. If a roll's result carries it beyond the upper limit of the list (above 24), that Plot Point and any remaining Plot Points may be freely chosen. This 'proceed down the list' method is used instead of complete randomization, as the Plot Point list grows more 'powerful' and 'epic' the further down the list one goes; by proceeding down the list to gain Plot Points, a character is more likely to gain 'mundane' Plot Points first. This helps to prevent a character from being unreasonably a <strong><em>'</em></strong><strong><em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMary_Sue&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFSEWdVoCQhamQch5RFVOUS2F_3oA">Mary Sue</a></em></strong><strong><em>.'</em></strong></p>
 
<p>If the GM calls for Plot Points to be freely chosen, this free choice must be done after any random rolling of Plot Points takes place. Each player may choose any remaining Plot Points, but may not (without GM permission) choose any Plot Points they have already gained (some Plot Points may be appropriate for being chosen more than once, such as Perfectest Pet, where other Plot Points are not appropriate for being chosen more than once, such as Fantastic Family).</p>
 
<p>All Plot Points gained should be developed along with the GM, to work out the details and any questions about them.</p>
 
<p><em>For example, Jelly Belly is entitled to five Plot Points by their GM; four rolled randomly, and one they may freely choose. Their player will thus first roll four d6's, one at a time. The first d6 result is a 6. Moving down the list of Plot Points from the beginning, the sixth Plot Point is #6, "Masterful Mentor." The second d6 result is 1. Moving down the list from Masterful Mentor, the first Plot Point is #7, "Da Magics." The third d6 result is 6. Moving down the list from Da Magics, the sixth Plot Point is #13, "Home Sweet Home." The fourth d6 result is 3. Moving down the list from Home Sweet Home, the third Plot Point is #16, "Mare Of Mystery." Thus, from the four Plot Point rolls, Jelly Belly has Masterful Mentor, Da Magics, Home Sweet Home, and Mare Of Mystery; he has a teacher or mentor, some kind of artistic talent, a unique home or residence, and a secret identity. Finally, as his one freely chosen Plot Point, he chooses #14, "Fan Club." His player works with the GM to determine the details of each of his Plot Points and how they may impact the story.</em></p>
 
 <h3 name="p9-1-1"> Plot Points List</h3>  
<ol><li><strong><em>Fantastic Family:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a large extended family; how this plays into a story is up to the GM, from anything from the premise of an Episode being that you're visiting relatives in a distant city, to having a relative visit you, or anything between.</li><li><strong><em>Perfectest Pet:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a unique pet; your pet's uniqueness can be in its type (such as an exotic animal), or its unique behavior. Alternatively, your pet could be generally normal, but be a paragon of its type (such as being 'merely' a dog, but being the best dog a dog can be).</li><li><strong><em>Kooky:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have largely harmless eccentricities; strange mannerisms, superstitions, convictions, or traditions which often strike those who don't know you (and some who do) as being odd and incomprehensible.</li><li><strong><em>Big Sibling, Best Friend:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have either a younger or older sibling, and the two of you are close; though you may not always be nearby, and though you may fight or argue, you do care for each other. At the GM's discretion, your sibling may have an impact on the story.</li><li><strong><em>Half-Pint:</em></strong>&nbsp;You appear to be noticeably younger than you actually are, or are smaller or appear more delicate than what is normal for others of your race. This doesn't necessarily restrict your capabilities, but it often makes others view you as weaker or less of a threat than they might otherwise.</li><li><strong><em>Masterful Mentor:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a teacher or mentor who cares about you and has your best interests at heart – even though they may not always directly help you. How your mentor influences your story is up to the GM.</li><li><strong><em>Da Magics:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have some kind of inherent artistic talent, from taking photos to painting, from singing to sewing. While you may not actually be skilled at it, your work has some inherent charm or quality to it which generally makes it turn out all right.</li><li><strong><em>In A Big Tasty Stew:</em></strong>&nbsp;Those who meet you for the first time often feel unsettled or intimidated by you for some reason. This can work to your advantage in that foes tend to be afraid of you to begin with, but can make social situations difficult. Those who get to know you, even a little bit, quickly get over this initial apprehension.</li><li><strong><em>Friends With Everypony:</em></strong>&nbsp;After knowing someone for even a relatively short time, you tend to know a great deal about them whether through memorization or intuition; and you typically keep up with people you know and like, being always kept aware of details about their lives.</li><li><strong><em>Fortune's Favor:</em></strong>&nbsp;You are notably wealthy, whether through assets and goods, or through direct monetary wealth. The degree of wealth you have, and how much of it you have access to, is up to the GM; as well as how this may impact the story.</li><li><strong><em>Just A Hunch:</em></strong>&nbsp;You get 'hunches' sometimes, inexplicable bits of information which may or may not be correct. At the GM's discretion, they may give you the information which makes up one of these 'hunches.'</li><li><strong><em>Diamond In The Rough:</em></strong>&nbsp;You are especially attractive, or endearing. This can take the form of physical attractiveness and beauty, or cute / adorable mannerisms. Not everyone will react the same way to you, however, as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</li><li><strong><em>Home Sweet Home:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a unique home or residence; anything from a tree house to a cloud, or more exotic – such as an airship. Alternatively, your home might be relatively normal on its surface, but have unique features inside; such as basement laboratories or the like. The GM has final say over the details of your residence.</li><li><strong><em>Fan Club:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have either a group of fans, or one truly die-hard fan. While you can't control these fans directly (and they may get into, or start, trouble through their active fandom), they tend to hang on your every word almost to the point of obsession.</li><li><strong><em>Special Somepony:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a love interest, a special somepony you are romantically attracted to; however, this may be an unrequited or one-sided attraction as easily as it may be a mutual romantic interest. How this may play into a given story is left up to the GM.</li><li><strong><em>Mare Of Mystery:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a secret identity, which includes anything from being a costumed hero, to writing for the local newspaper under a pseudonym. This affords you some leeway in your activities in the form of anonymity, as long as you maintain and protect your alter-ego.</li><li><strong><em>Wide, Wide World:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have been on long travels across Equestria (or beyond, if the GM allows). This may provide you with some insight into things which are exotic or unknown to others, at the GM's discretion.</li><li><strong><em>Jester, Sailor, Soldier, Spy:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have an important job, whether it's being the mayor of a small town, a royal guard, a rodeo judge, or something else. Typically, your job gives you some kind of authority in certain situations, at the GM's discretion.</li><li><strong><em>Best In Show:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have won awards or honors in the past; this can take the form of competition trophies, medals of military service, even good grades in school. While this gives you a certain degree of prestige, it can also increase the expectations of others about you.</li><li><strong><em>Studious Student:</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a student or apprentice, who looks to you for guidance and assistance, and who you can give instructions and assignments within reason--without controlling them directly. The nature and extent of your relationship with your apprentice is up to the GM.</li><li><strong><em>Far And Wide:</em></strong>&nbsp;You are famous in one way or another, viewed as a celebrity or an individual of note for some reason. Typically, those who have heard of you have a pre-conceived opinion about you one way or another; those who approve of you like you immediately, those who disapprove can be hostile toward you without considering your actions and behavior.</li><li><strong><em>Daring Is As Daring Does:</em></strong>&nbsp;Danger, adventure, and thrilling heroics tend to follow you wherever you go, even into the minutiae of your daily life in one way or another. This tends to make your life more interesting than others, but can also make it more hazardous from day to day.</li><li><strong><em>Derpy Ex Machina:</em></strong>&nbsp;From time to time, but always rarely, something (often silly or ridiculous) will happen to you or happen around you, seemingly without cause or precedent. Sometimes, this works out in your favor, saving you from something terrible; sometimes, however, this can cause things to become much harder on you.</li><li><strong><em>Fulfill Your Destiny:</em></strong>&nbsp;It seems that fate has conspired to bring about your existence, and you are a living nexus of important events. Whatever is occurring in the world at large, from the ancient plans and machinations of powerful entities, to rare and strange occurrences in the natural world, you are often at the center of it. How this may play into a given story is left up to the GM.</li></ol>
