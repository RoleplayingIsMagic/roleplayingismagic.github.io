                        <h2 name="p4-6"> D.A.S.H. Example</h2>  
<p>Here you will find a step-by-step example of character creation, using S4E's D.A.S.H. process, to help new players understand how it works. In this example, our player <em>'Tom'</em>&nbsp;will create his S4E character, <em>'Thrifty'</em>&nbsp;– a humble and simple pony who just might have the makings of a hero.</p>
 <h3 name="p4-6-1"> D - Design</h3> <p><strong><em>Race: </em></strong>The first step of character creation is for Tom to decide what Race his character Thrifty will be. He decides that Thrifty will be an Earth Pony, as their hard-working, hooves-on nature best suits his idea for Thrifty.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Description: </em></strong>The next step is for Tom to describe Thrifty. Tom decides that, like himself, Thrifty is pretty average; average height, a generally average build, unremarkable tan coat, short brown mane and tail, and hazel eyes--an everyday citizen of Equestria. He also decides that Thrifty is a quintessential tinkerer, always fixing up old things; because of this, Thrifty is always a little covered in dust, and also always carries a saddle bag full of 'tinkering tools' and small spare parts around with him. Tom decides Thrifty is usually friendly and relaxed, with a 'can-do' attitude.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Concept: </em></strong>The next step is for Tom to define Thrifty's core concept, with his Background, Perspective, and Direction. Tom decides to keep Thrifty's Background simple; the youngest of a big family, he had an interest in repairing old things from an early age, so he eventually moved to his new home to open a general repair shop. This feeds into his Perspective; Thrifty hasn't gotten enough money together to start his shop yet, so he is always on the lookout for work that needs to be done. This gives him his friendly, can-do attitude; he's always willing to help out and mend what's been broken. This, in turn, feeds into his Direction; Thrifty wants to help ponies with the simple things in their lives which need fixing. He has no grand aspirations of being a hero and saving Equestria, he's simply willing to work hard to help make everypony's life a little better in his own small way. (Of course, it is this quiet and humble virtue which might one day make Thrifty into one of Equestria's heroes…)</p>
 <h3 name="p4-6-2"> A - Aspects</h3> <p><strong><em>Guiding Element: </em></strong>The next step is for Tom to decide which Guiding Element is the one which best matches who Thrifty is. This, thanks to the previous section of character creation, is an easy task for Tom; Thrifty obviously best matches the Element of Generosity. He could also match Kindness, as the two are similar in some ways; but after talking with his GM, Tom decides that Generosity is better because Thrifty wants to have an active part in doing good work--he wants to be 'hooves-on,' so to speak. Following this ideal and striving to embody it, especially when it is difficult to do so, will help Thrifty regain spent Valor during gameplay.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Fatal Flaw: </em></strong>The next step is for Tom to determine what Thrifty's Fatal Flaw is. After taking some time to consider who Thrifty is as an individual, reviewing the past sections of character creation for reference, and talking with his GM, Tom decides that because Thrifty works on mending broken things and fixing up old things which have worn out, his Fatal Flaw is that Thrifty has a hard time letting go of things, whether material things, situations, problems, or other ponies. This makes Thrifty hesitant to change or give up on something, and that can lead him into trouble. During gameplay, whenever Thrifty is faced with a dilemma which plays on his Fatal Flaw, he will make checks without the aid of his Attributes.</p><h3 name="p4-6-3"> S - Statistics</h3> <p><strong>Attributes: </strong>The next step is for Tom to read and learn Thrifty's three Attributes: <em>Mind</em>, <em>Body</em>, and <em>Heart</em>. Each of these Attributes will begin with a score of 1 for now, and Tom will have the opportunity later on in character creation to improve them through purchasing the appropriate Edges.</p>
 
<p><strong>Fortitude & Willpower: </strong>The next step is for Tom to understand Thrifty's Fortitude and Willpower scores, and calculate their initial values. His Fortitude is calculated as <em>(Body x 10) + (Heart x 5)</em>, and his Willpower is <em>(Mind x 10) + (Heart x 5)</em>. Because all of his Attributes are currently at a score of 1, both his Fortitude and Willpower scores are currently 15. This may increase later in character creation depending on the choices Tom makes for Thrifty.</p>
 
<p><strong>Valor: </strong>The next step is for Tom to learn about Valor, and to determine Thrifty's starting and maximum Valor score. Thrifty's Valor score is equal to his Heart Attribute, which is currently 1, meaning Thrifty's Valor is also currently 1. This may increase later as character creation continues.</p><h3 name="p4-6-4"> H - Headway</h3> <p><strong>Skills: </strong>The next step is for Tom to learn about Skills. While Thrifty does not begin with any Skills by default, he may acquire them depending on the choices Tom makes later on as character creation continues.</p>
 
<p><strong>Edges: </strong>The next step is for Tom to learn about Edges. Like Skills, Thrifty does not begin with any Edges by default, but he may purchase them later in character creation by spending Experience Points (XP). Edges are the primary way in which Thrifty will gain power, ability, and knowledge.</p>
 
<p><strong>Experience: </strong>The final step is for Tom to put all of his knowledge and conceptualizing of Thrifty to use by spending Experience Points (XP) to purchase Edges to improve Thrifty's capabilities. He finds out from his GM that Thrifty (like all of the characters in Tom's game group) starts in the <em>Adult</em>&nbsp;tier of experience, which gives him 60 XP to spend on Edges to advance his character. The following is how Tom spends Thrifty's starting XP:</p>
<ol><li><strong><em>Gifted (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to increase his Mind score from 1 to 2, and subsequently increases his Willpower from 15 to 25 (+10).</li><li><strong><em>Gifted (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to increase his Body score from 1 to 2, and subsequently increases his Fortitude from 15 to 25 (+10).</li><li><strong><em>Gifted (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to increase his Heart score from 1 to 2, and subsequently increases both his Fortitude and Willpower from 25 to 30 (+5 each). The Heart increase also increases his Valor from 1 to 2.</li><li><strong><em>Improved Gifted (10 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to increase his Mind score from 2 to 3, and subsequently increases his Willpower from 30 to 40 (+10).</li><li><strong><em>Improved Gifted (10 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to increase his Heart score from 2 to 3, and subsequently increases his Fortitude from 30 to 35, and his Willpower from 40 to 45 (+5 each). &nbsp;The Heart increase also increases his Valor from 2 to 3.</li><li><strong><em>Skill Training (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to reflect his training and skill in repairing things. Tom works with his GM to describe and define the details of this Skill, and they call it <em>"Repair."</em>&nbsp;Thrifty will roll an extra 1d6 when he makes a check to which Repair would apply, and he will choose the best two d6 results to add to the check.</li><li><strong><em>Improved Skill Training (10 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to reflect his more advanced training and skill in repairing things. He chooses his <em>"Repair"</em>&nbsp;Skill, and applies this Edge to it. Thrifty will now roll an additional extra 1d6 (for a total of 2d6 extra) when he makes a check to which Repair would apply, and he will choose the best two d6 results to add to the check.</li><li><strong><em>Special Purpose (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to reflect that he has gotten his Cutie Mark. Tom works with his GM to define Thrifty's special purpose as, <em>"To mend the broken." </em>They also determine that his Cutie Mark is a wrench and a screwdriver, crossed over each other. Whenever Thrifty's special purpose applies to a check he is making, he will ignore any and all Drawbacks he might otherwise suffer for that check.</li><li><strong><em>Talented (5 XP):</em></strong>&nbsp;Thrifty purchases this Edge to reflect his inherent talent with using the materials available, instead of having to rely on specialized tools, to get the job done. Tom works with his GM to describe and define this Talent, and they call it <em>"Resourceful."</em>&nbsp;Whenever Thrifty makes a check to which this Talent applies, he gains a +1 bonus to his check result.</li></ol>
 
<p>With the final step of character creation complete, Tom has finished creating Thrifty, and the handy-pony is ready for his first Episode!</p>
