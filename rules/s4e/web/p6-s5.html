<p>Below is the full text for all 116 Edges in S4E, listed alphabetically and grouped as applicable, with Race restrictions (including the <em>Wide, Wide World</em>&nbsp;variant Races), XP costs, purchase restrictions / prerequisites, the full rules for each Edge, and a special note for any Edges which may be purchased more than once.</p>
 
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Arcane Talent </strong><em>[5 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Alicorns and Unicorns may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Gain a <em>+1</em>&nbsp;bonus to checks made involving spells or magic.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Arcane Talent</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Arcane Talent to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Unicorns may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Improve the Arcane Talent bonus to <em>+2</em>.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Artifice</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>At the beginning of each Episode, without making a check, you may create a number of single-use magical items equal to your Mind score, each of which duplicates a spell with a difficulty no higher than Simple. Any character may be able to make use of these magical items, at the GM's discretion. If these items are not used by the end of the Episode in which they were created, they expire and are lost.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Artifice</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Artifice to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Alicorns, Changelings, Crystal Races, Dragons, Unicorns, and Zebras may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Out of the magic items you create, you may now create one magic item which duplicates a spell with a maximum difficulty of Average. In addition, whenever one of your magic items is used, you may spend a point of Valor to keep the item while still gaining the benefits of its use (in effect, spending the Valor in place of the item).</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Artifice</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Improved Artifice to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Unicorns and Zebras may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Out of the magic items you create, you may now create one magic item which duplicates a spell with a maximum difficulty of Difficult. In addition, all of your other magic items may now duplicate spells with a maximum difficulty of Average.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Bits And Bobs</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>Once per Episode, you may declare that your character has an item pertaining to the current situation, by pure chance. Work with your GM to determine what the item is.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Blaster Caster</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>When you cast a spell, roll <em>1d6</em>. Reduce the cost of casting the spell by the result. This effect cannot reduce the cost of casting the spell below 1.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Blaster Caster</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Blaster Caster to purchase.)</em></li><li>When you cast a spell, roll a total of <em>2d6</em>&nbsp;and choose the highest result. Reduce the cost of casting the spell by that result. This effect cannot reduce the cost of casting the spell below 1.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Blaster Caster</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Blaster Caster to purchase.)</em></li><li>When you cast a spell, roll a total of <em>3d6</em>&nbsp;and choose the highest result. Reduce the cost of casting the spell by that result. This effect cannot reduce the cost of casting the spell below 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Bloodhound</strong><em>&nbsp;[5 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Diamond Dogs and Griffons may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Gain a <em>+1</em>&nbsp;bonus to checks made involving finding and following scents.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Bloodhound</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Bloodhound to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Diamond Dogs and Griffons may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Improve the Bloodhound bonus to <em>+2</em>.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Chaotic Magic</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>Whenever you are casting a spell, after you have paid the cost of the spell, you may choose to invoke 'chaotic magic.' If you do, roll <em>1d6</em>. On a result of 2, 3, or 4, nothing happens; proceed with casting the spell as normal. On a result of 5, the cost you paid to cast the spell is immediately refunded to you. On a result of 6, your dice results for making the spell's check are automatically treated as results of 6. On a result of 1, however, the spell automatically fails--and goes haywire in an often hilariously ironic, and possibly dangerous, way (at the GM's discretion) . For example, a spell intended to create a blizzard might instead create a tiny snowstorm which only annoys the caster – or it might backfire and freeze the caster solid, at the GM's discretion.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Courage</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>Whenever you are dealt Willpower damage, reduce the damage dealt to you by 2, to a minimum of 1 point of Willpower damage inflicted.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Courage</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Courage to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Buffalo, Donkeys, and Earth Ponies may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Increase the reduction to 4, to a minimum of 1 point of Willpower damage inflicted.</li></ul>

<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Defining Attribute</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Greater Gifted to purchase.)</em></li><li>Choose one Attribute to which you have applied the Greater Gifted Edge. Improve your score in that Attribute by 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Determination</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>Increase your maximum Willpower by 5.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Determination</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Determination to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Donkeys may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Increase your maximum Willpower by an additional 5 (to a total of <em>+10</em>).</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Determination</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Improved Determination to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Donkeys may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Increase your maximum Willpower by an additional 5 (to a total of <em>+15</em>).</li></ul>

<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Doormat To Dynamo</strong><em>&nbsp;[5 XP]</em></li><li>Once per Episode, you may spend a point of Valor to gain an increasing bonus to checks you make until the end of the Scene. This bonus begins at +1 when you start this effect, and each check you make increases this bonus by +1 for the next check you make. This effect lasts until the end of the Scene, or until you achieve a Dramatic Success--either of which ends this effect.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Doormat To Dynamo</strong><em>&nbsp;[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Doormat To Dynamo to purchase.)</em></li><li>You may now use Doormat To Dynamo twice per Episode, but only once per Scene.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Doormat To Dynamo</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Improved Doormat To Dynamo to purchase.)</em></li><li>You may now use Doormat To Dynamo three times per Episode, but only once per Scene.</li></ul>

Dragon fire, phoenix flame, and other magical sources of fire at the GM's discretion can still harm you.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Eagle Eye</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Griffons may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Gain a +1 bonus to checks made centering on visual observation and awareness, as long as the check is made in good lighting (such as daylight).

<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Eagle Eye</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Eagle Eye to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Griffons may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>Improve the Eagle Eye bonus to <em>+2</em>. The darkness-limitation on when the Eagle Eye bonus applies remains in effect.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Eagle Eye</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Requires Improved Eagle Eye to purchase.)</em></li><li><em>(Only Griffons may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>You no longer suffer the darkness-limitation on when the Eagle Eye bonus applies.</li></ul>
<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Echolocation</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Bat Ponies may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li>You are able to freely use a hypersonic form of sonar to 'see' your surroundings as easily as if you were looking with your eyes, with a few notable differences. While you are able to make out the shape of things in your surroundings, you see everything as silhouettes; you cannot discern fine visual details, such as the text on the page of a book, the color of the paint on a wall, the expression on somepony's face, and the like. You may use this sense freely even if you are blinded, but cannot use it if you are deafened. If you remain still while using this sense, you can 'see' in 360 degrees all around you.</li></ul>

<hr>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Exotic Lore</strong> <em>[5 XP]</em></li><li>Once per Episode, when making a check for which you have no applicable Skill, you may treat the check as if you had the Skill Training Edge with an applicable Skill.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Improved Exotic Lore</strong> <em>[10 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Zebras may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li><em>(Requires Exotic Lore to purchase.)</em></li><li>You may now use Exotic Lore up to two times per Episode.</li></ul>
 
<ul class="with_header"><li><strong>Greater Exotic Lore</strong> <em>[15 XP]</em></li><li><em>(Only Zebras may purchase this Edge.)</em></li><li><em>(Requires Improved Exotic Lore to purchase.)</em></li><li>You may now use Exotic Lore up to three times per Episode.
