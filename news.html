        <h2>Watercolor Painting Giveaway<span class="date">Wednesday, June 20th, 2012</span></h2>
        <p>Hay, everypony!</p>
        <p>Tall Tail here.</p>
        <p>Well, it's the Summer Solstice, which means today marks 2012's Summer Sun Celebration for the brony community! In honor of this, the team over here at My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic would like to announce that our first <strong>Watercolor Painting Giveaway</strong> is now open! Over the next month, to help us get together the bits to allow our globally-scattered team to come together at brony conventions (not to mention help us cover development and hosting costs, and facilitate future content), we're holding a donation-drawing! For every dollar donated during the drive, a donator gets one 'ticket.' At the end of the month, we'll randomly determine <emph>two winners</emph> based on these tickets--so the more someone feels like donating, the better their chances of winning; but it only takes one ticket to throw your hat in the ring. The winners will be contacted and given their choice (in order of drawing) of any one of the three original watercolor paintings done by Sketchbook for the My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic, Season Two Edition game book!</p>
        <p>To enter, use the "Donate" link on the right-hand side. Remember to include contact information with your donation, so we know how to get in touch with you if you win! The giveaway ends <strong>July 20th,</strong> and as a special 'thank you' to those awesome people who have donated already, if you've previously donated to us, you've already got tickets entered in the drawing!</p>
        <p>If you don't have the bits to donate, or simply would rather not, don't worryâ€”we still want you to have a shot at winning one of these gorgeous paintings! For a 'no purchase necessary' entry, send an email to <a href="mailto:TallTailTellsTales@gmail.com">TallTailTellsTales@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "<strong>Giveaway Entry</strong>," and make sure to include your contact information in the body of the email! Email entries will gain one ticket in the drawing, so while donations can gain multiple tickets and a better chance of winning, email entries still have a shot!</p>
        <p>Below are links to the three watercolor paintings the winner will be able to choose from:</p>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5IFnI6cpZN4Z0lDSTJ1Mk1yR3c">Once Upon A Time, In The Magical Land Of Equestria"</a> by Sketchbook (Michael Simpson)<br />
